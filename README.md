# Credit Card Fraud Detection

**Author:** Naphat Piphattanakarn

## Objectives

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for the Credit Card Fraud Detection project. The main objective is to build and evaluate the performance of various classifiers with hyperparameter tuning to detect fraudulent credit card transactions with the aim of developing practical models for real-world use cases.

## Dataset Information

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). It consists of 284,807 transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset comprises 30 features as follows:

- V1 - V28: Features resulting from a PCA transformation due to confidentiality issues.
- Time: The time elapsed in seconds between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
- Amount: The transaction amount.
- Class: The label, which takes the value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.
